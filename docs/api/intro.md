The BlitzMax APIs are a collection of core modules designed to help you build a great BlitzMax application.

They include Modules for things such as image loading, audio handling,
fast 2D graphics, lua integration, threading, and window-based user interfaces.

They are split into what are known as `modscopes` in BlitzMax parlance, or
perhaps more familiarly as `namespaces`.

The Blitz Runtime Libraries (`BRL`), contain the core of BlitzMax functionality that you
are likely to use from day to day.

`MaxGUI` provides access to native windowing toolkits, such as Cocoa on macOS
and GTK+3 on Linux, allowing you to build complex user interface-driven
applications.

The `PUB` modscope generally contains third party libraries and platform-specific
helpers. These are considered more low-level, and generally you won't use
these modules directly.

`Crypto` provides several different cryptographic utilities, such has message digests.

The `SDL` modscope can be used as a replacement graphics and system-integration
backend for the default modules provided by `BRL`. It is optional on the main
desktop platforms, but generally required on the other targets (iOS, Android, rpi, NX).
It is a full implementation of SDL in BlitzMax, including SDL's Render and Window subsystems,
which can be used directly if preferred.

The `Steam` modscope is for integrating your game with Steam, providing access to all the commonly used Steam APIs,
such as friends, leader boards and Steam Workshop.
